		<p>Everyone has had problems finding classes -- especially classes that are open and fulfill requirements. Both Megan and John were enrolled in {% course HCDE310 %} and decided to do a project together. They set out to correct some of the problems they found with the UW course catalog. Specifically, they wanted to unit all of the separate pieces of information about courses and instructors.  </p>
